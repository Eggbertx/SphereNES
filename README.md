# SphereNES

A not-yet-operational NES emulator in the miniSphere game engine with a retargetable [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) module

The `lib/hello.nes` ROM is used for testing SphereNES and was compiled from the [cc65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65) hello.c sample. It and the rest of the cc65 codebase are under the terms of the zlib license.
`roms/alive` comes from http://6502asm.com. I'm not sure what the license is there.
